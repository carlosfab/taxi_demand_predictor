Predict the upcoming hour's user demand for NYC taxi. This enables optimization of fleet distribution and potential revenue increase. This guide covers all project aspects, from setup to contribution.


> **Note**: This project is currently a work in progress. I will be making significant updates throughout this week.

# Web App Overview

The app employs a trained LightGBM model to predict taxi demands for the next hour. Data from January 2022 onwards is stored in a Feature Store on HopsWorks, and new data is fetched every 60 minutes using GitHub Actions.

The web app serves as an interface to visualize real-time predictions, rendered as a time series plot. It offers filters for location selection and provides monitoring of key performance metrics.
