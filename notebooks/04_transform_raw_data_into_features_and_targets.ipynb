    "# ðŸ“• 04 - Transform Raw Data into Features and Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After having diligently walked through the preliminary stages of data exploration, validation, and transformation in the first three notebooks, it's time to consolidate our understanding and build a more streamlined pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, our approach will evolve from a more exploratory stance to a structured one. Rather than manually handling the data transformations, we'll be leveraging functions defined in the `src` directory. This modular approach ensures reusability and better code management. While we previously dealt with a single month's data to ensure the feasibility of our methods, we'll now scale our operations to handle an entire year's worth of data. All of these transformations and data handling functions will be encapsulated in `data.py` located within the `src` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal remains consistent: transforming the raw data into a structured format, apt for machine learning, with clearly defined features and targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load an Entire Year Raw Data**: \n",
    "    - We commenced by loading the complete dataset for a year, a significant uptick in volume compared to our initial explorations with just a month's data. This step set the stage for the subsequent transformations and provided a comprehensive view of the data landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transform Raw Data into TS Data**: \n",
    "    - With the raw data at hand, our next step was to mold it into a time series format. This transformation is essential, especially considering our data's temporal nature. It allowed us to capture the sequential dependencies present in the data, making it primed for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert Time Series Data into Features and Target**: \n",
    "    - After having our time series data ready, we further broke it down into distinct features and targets. The features encapsulate the historical data, while the target represents the future values we aim to predict. This structure aligns with typical supervised machine learning tasks, making the data ready for model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save Tabular Data**: \n",
    "    - Finally, with our data in the desired format, we persisted it for future use. This not only ensures that we can reuse the processed data without redoing the steps but also aids in data versioning, making our experimentation reproducible.\n"
