    "\n",
    "Now, I am going to establish baseline models to provide a comparison point for future, more complex machine learning models. Baselines are crucial for this very reason. They should be swift and straightforward, setting an initial standard for comparison. In this notebook, we'll delve into three baseline models:\n",

    "1. **Previous-Hour Predictor**: Forecasts the next hour's demand based on the prior hour.\n",

    "\n",
    "Upon evaluating our trio of baseline models, we observed a progressive reduction in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), underscoring the importance of choosing an effective strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Model v1 (Previous Hour Predictor)**: This initial model took a simplistic approach, forecasting based on the rides from just the preceding hour, resulting in an MAE of **6.0558**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Model v2 (Previous Week Predictor)**: This model, predicting based on the corresponding hour from the prior week, showcased the weekly patterns in ride demands, leading to a decreased MAE of **3.6811**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Model v3 (4-Weeks Predictor)**: By tapping into a broader historical context â€” specifically, the same hour's averages over the last four weeks â€” we saw a further reduced MAE of **3.1963**.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",

    "The continual improvement in MAE across these models illuminates the significance of incorporating historical patterns in our predictions. While none of these models utilize sophisticated machine learning algorithms, these baseline results serve as benchmarks. \n",
